# coordinate-system-simulation
A foundational Python project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically focusing on Data Classes and class composition.

 # Decorators: 
 Utilizing `@dataclass` for concise, readable class definitions and automatic dunder-method generation.
 # Encapsulation: 
 Grouping coordinate logic within the `Point` class.
 # Class Interaction: 
 Demonstrating how different classes (Point and Canvas) can interact within a coordinate system.

 # Language:
 Python 3.7+
 # Libraries:
 `dataclasses` (Standard Library)

 # How To Run
 ```bash
python coordinate_system_simulation.py
